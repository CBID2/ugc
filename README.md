## What are Community Articles?

Community articles are user-generated content (UGC) written by the Codecademy community, available to developers all over the world! Here are some examples:

- [Web Scrape with Selenium and Beautiful Soup](https://github.com/Codecademy/ugc/blob/main/content/caupolicandiaz/web-scrape-with-selenium-and-beautiful-soup.md)
- [Build a Discord Bot with Node.js](https://github.com/Codecademy/ugc/blob/main/content/christine_yang/build-a-discord-bot-with-node-js.md)
- [Build a 3D Environment with Three.js](https://github.com/Codecademy/ugc/blob/main/content/brandondusch/build-a-3d-environment-with-three-js.md)
- [How to Convert CSS to SCSS](https://github.com/Codecademy/ugc/blob/main/content/kyrathompson/how-to-convert-css-to-scss.md)
- [Create a Stack in Python](https://github.com/Codecademy/ugc/blob/main/content/stevenswiniarski/create-a-stack-in-python.md)

## Why write articles?

- Establish your online presence as a developer and content creator.
- The best way to understand a concept is to explain it to someone else.
- Pay it forward: Share your learnings with the community as you level up.

## What stage of development are we in right now?

This is currently the beta phase of Community Articles. We are aiming to release 20 articles written by beta authors/Codecademy superusers. Let us know what you think!
