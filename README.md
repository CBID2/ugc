## What is UGC Articles?

User generated content (UGC) articles are free articles written by the Codecademy community, available to developers all over the world! Here are some examples:

- [Web Scrape with Selenium and Beautiful Soup](https://github.com/Codecademy/ugc/blob/main/content/caupolicandiaz/web-scrape-with-selenium-and-beautiful-soup.md)
- [Build a Discord Bot with Node.js](https://github.com/Codecademy/ugc/blob/main/content/christine_yang/build-a-discord-bot-with-node-js.md)
- [Build a 3D Environment with Three.js](https://github.com/Codecademy/ugc/blob/main/content/brandondusch/build-a-3d-environment-with-three-js.md)
- [How to Convert CSS to SCSS](https://github.com/Codecademy/ugc/blob/main/content/kyrathompson/how-to-convert-css-to-scss.md)

## Why write articles?

- Establish yourself online.
- The best way to understand a concept is to explain it to someone else.
- Pay it forward. Share your learnings with the community so other don't make the same pitfalls.

## What stage of development are we in right now?

This is currently the Beta version of UGC articles.
