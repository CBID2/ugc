## What are Community Articles?

Community articles are user-generated content (UGC) written by the Codecademy community, available to developers all over the world! Here are some examples:

- [Web Scrape with Selenium and Beautiful Soup](https://www.codecademy.com/article/caupolicandiaz/web-scrape-with-selenium-and-beautiful-soup) by **Paul Daiz**
- [Build a Discord Bot with Node.js](https://www.codecademy.com/article/christine_yang/build-a-discord-bot-with-node-js) by **Christine Yang**
- [Build a 3D Environment with Three.js](https://www.codecademy.com/article/brandondusch/build-a-3d-environment-with-three-js) by **Brandon Dusch**
- [How to Convert CSS to SCSS](https://www.codecademy.com/article/kyrathompson/how-to-convert-css-to-scss) by **Kyra Thompson**
- [Create a Stack in Python](https://www.codecademy.com/article/stevenswiniarski/create-a-stack-in-python ) by **Steven Swiniarski**

## Why write articles?

- Establish your online presence as a developer and content creator.
- The best way to understand a concept is to explain it to someone else.
- Pay it forward: Share your learnings with the community as you level up.

## What stage of development are we in right now?

This is currently the beta phase of Community Articles. We are aiming to release 20 articles written by beta authors/Codecademy superusers. Let us know what you think!
