## Introduction 

Picture this, you're scrolling through the internet, find a cookie recipe,  and click on the Share button to the send this link to your friend:
(https://downshiftology.com/recipes/gluten-free-chocolate-chip-cookies/) 
You see `gluten-free-chocolate-chip-cookies` after the backblash (“/”)? This is called a **slug**. It is a part in the URL that identifies a specific page in a website to make easier for people to read. In other words, slugs explains the content on the page. In this article, you will learn the importance of slugs in your SEO strategy, how to create them, and best practices.   

## Why Are Slugs Important to SEO Strategy?

Even though slugs won't have a direct impact on how your content ranks on the web, they do influence a visitor's decision on whether to view your content or not. Here's how:

1. **Increases Search Ranking:** Cannibalization is a common issue for content creators. It's when most of the blog posts, articles, and other pieces of content on a website share the same keyword. This making it difficult for people to find them on your site. Slugs solve this issue by putting a unique name like a title or heading, thus, making it easier for people to find a person's work. Think of this as the names of the folders on your Google Drive or OneDrive account. 

2.  **Improves Shareability:** 
Adding slugs to your content's urls make them shorter, thus, making it easier for your viewers to copy, paste, and send them to other people. 
Now, let's create a slug! 

## How to Create a Slug 
Consider using the following methods to creating a slug:
### Method # 1: Manually 
1. **Think of a short yet descriptive name:**  We recommend making it easy for people to remember. For example,  let's say a person wanted to create a slug for the blog post titled "How to Make Your Issue Requests Come True".

2. **Place hyphens("-") in between the parts of your name:** Doing this in the slug would make it easier for users to access the link as they would have to use a CAPS Lock to view the content.  Here's how it would look with the blog post referenced in the previous step: `how-to-make-your-issues-requests-come-true`.
3. **Done:** Your URL is now SEO-Friendly 
### Method 2: Use an URL Slug Generator 
Creating a URL slug for your content can sometimes very be time consuming, so we suggest using a tool like [slugify.online](https://slugify.online/)  to help you finish quickly:

## Best Practices 
When it comes to creating a URL slug, keep the following practices in mind:
1. **Keep them Short:** According to [John Mueller from Google(start at 19:00)](https://www.youtube.com/live/4FkSZIW6d48?feature=share),  Google favors URLs under 2,000 characters. With that it mind, it's best to keep your slugs within that limit so your content can been ranked in that search engine.  
2. **Match it to the page's content:** This ensures that Google and other search engines will rank it based on the query it falls into. 
3. **No upper-case:** When creating slugs, it's best to present them in lower-case letters. This can prevent 404 error pages and content duplication from appearing whenever someone views your content.
