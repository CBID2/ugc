_**Prerequisites:** Understanding of Python and Django._

_**Versions:** Python 3.8.10, Django 4.0.4_

## Introduction
GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. Unlike a REST api, Graphql apiâ€™s do not require verbs(PUT,POST,GET) for requests, they do not need multiple Endpoints. They have just one endpoint and making a query to that endpoint is all that's needed. 

This tutorial will cover the creation of a CRUD(create,read,update,delete)graphql api for a restaurant with django.

 **Properties of Graphql**:

The following terms would be used a lot when interacting with graphql.
- schema
- query
- Nesting
- Mutation
- Subscription
- Resolvers

**Schema:** 
A schema is a collection of types. A type is a collection of fields. A field is a property of a type.

**Query:**
A Query is a type on a schema that defines the kind of operations that can be done to get data.
Creating a query involves adding fields to a query type, then creating resolvers for the fields

**Resolvers:**
They are functions that return values for fields that exist on types in a schema. 

**Mutation:**
A mutation is a type on a schema that defines the kind of operations that can be done to modify data.

**Subscription:**
A subscription in graphql i

**Nesting:**
A nested query is a query that is a child of another query.

## Setting up graphql with django
First, we need to install Django and create a project. I will be using a bash script i created to do this.
[Django-bash-script](https://github.com/Smyja/Django-bash)

To use graphql with django, you will need to install graphene-django

```pip install graphene-django```

Add it to your settings.py file:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'graphene_django',

    # ...
]
```
If you run the server, you see this error:
```ImportError: cannot import name 'force_text' from 'django.utils.encoding```

add this to your settings.py file:

```python
import django
from django.utils.encoding import force_str

django.utils.encoding.force_text = force_str

```
or downgrade your django version.

Create a Models.py file in your project that contains tthe models you want to use.:
```python
from django.db import models
class Restaurant(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    address = models.CharField(max_length=200)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
```


Add a graphql route to your urls.py file for django 2.0 and above:

```python
from graphene_django.views import GraphQLView
from django.views.decorators.csrf import csrf_exempt
from djql.schema import schema #change djql to your app name

urlpatterns = [
    path("graphql", csrf_exempt(GraphQLView.as_view(graphiql=True, schema=schema))),
]
```

Graphql comes with an api browser similar to django's browsable api that you can use to test your queries and mutations. If you do not want to use it, you can set the `graphiql` parameter to False.
The fourth import statement ```from djql.schema import schema``` is the schema that we will use to create our queries. Create a `schema.py` file in your project directory or your app directory.
Django's csrf_exempt decorator is used to allow API clients to POST to the graphql endpoint we have created.

Create a Graphql Type for your models on your schema.py file as shown below:
```python
import graphene
from graphene_django import DjangoObjectType
from djql.models import Restaurant

class Query(graphene.ObjectType):
    """
    Queries for the Restaurant model
    """
    restaurants = graphene.List(RestaurantType)

    def resolve_restaurants(self, info, **kwargs):
      return Restaurant.objects.all()

```
Start the django server with `python manage.py runsrver` then visit the `/graphql` route to see the api browser, it should look like this

![Api browser](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Smyja/ugc/grahql-with-django/content/smyja/api-browser.png)


To get the list of Restaurants run a query with this
```graphql
query {
    restaurants {
        id
        name
        address
    }
}

```
Output should look like this:
![list of restaurants](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Smyja/ugc/grahql-with-django/content/smyja/restaurant-list.png)


To modify any data in our database we would need to create a mutation.
Below is the Create Restaurant mutation,add it to the `schema.py` file.
```python
class CreateRestaurant(graphene.Mutation):
    class Arguments:
        name = graphene.String()
        address = graphene.String()

    ok = graphene.Boolean() 
    restaurant = graphene.Field(RestaurantType)

    def mutate(self, info, name, address):
        restaurant = Restaurant(name=name, address=address)
        restaurant.save()

        return CreateRestaurant(ok=True, restaurant=restaurant)
```
The CreateRestaurant Mutation takes in the model fields as argument while the mutate function is where the db change happens using django's orm.

Create a Mutation class then Initialize the mutation with the schema.
```python
class Mutation(graphene.ObjectType):
    create_restaurant = CreateRestaurant.Field()
```
After adding the mutation and query, define the schema at the end of the `schema.py` file.

```schema = graphene.Schema(query=Query, mutation=Mutation)```

Start the server and a run a mutation with the graphql api browser using this 

```graphql
mutation {
    createRestaurant(name: "Kada Plaza", address: "Lekki GARDENS") {
        ok
        restaurant {
            id
            name
            address
        }
    }
}
```
The mutation returns a restaurant object with the fields that were passed in.

Once the mutation is created, we can use it to delete a restaurant.
To delete a restaurant, we would need to create a mutation.
Below is the Delete Restaurant mutation,add it to the `schema.py` file.
```python
class DeleteRestaurant(graphene.Mutation):
    class Arguments:
        id = graphene.Int()

    ok = graphene.Boolean()

    def mutate(self, info, id):
        restaurant = Restaurant.objects.get(id=id)
        restaurant.delete()

        return DeleteRestaurant(ok=True)
```
Add Delete Restaurant mutation to the Mutation class.

```delete_restaurant = DeleteRestaurant.Field()```

Run the mutation with the graphql api browser using this.

```graphql  
    mutation {
        deleteRestaurant(id: 1) {
            ok
        }
    }
```
Pass the restaurant id as an argument to the mutation as shown above.
Output should look like this:
```json
{
    "data": {
        "deleteRestaurant": {
            "ok": true
        }
    }
}
```
    Note: Run a query to get the list of restaurants again to see the change.

To update a restaurant, we would need to create a mutation.
Below is the Update Restaurant mutation,add it to the `schema.py` file.
```python
class UpdateRestaurant(graphene.Mutation):
    class Arguments:
        id = graphene.Int()
        name = graphene.String()
        address = graphene.String()

    ok = graphene.Boolean()
    restaurant = graphene.Field(RestaurantType)

    def mutate(self, info, id, name, address):
        restaurant = Restaurant.objects.get(id=id)
        restaurant.name = name
        restaurant.address = address
        restaurant.save()

        return UpdateRestaurant(ok=True, restaurant=restaurant)
```

Run the mutation with the graphql api browser using this.
``` graphql
    mutation {
        updateRestaurant(id: 2, name: "Kada Plaza Ltd", address: "Lekki Gardens") {
            ok
            restaurant {
                id
                name
                address
            }
        }
    }
```
