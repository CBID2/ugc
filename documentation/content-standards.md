# Content Standards

## Components of an Article

All UGC entries are Markdown files and should consist of three parts:

- The **file name**, with the **.md** extension.
- The **metadata** about the content, written in YAML, which appears at the top of the article file.
- The **content**, written in Markdown.

We'll describe the standards for each of these components separately.

### File Name

All article file names use the **.md** format along with the following standards:

- They must match the title of the article. (e.g. "Build a 3D Environment with Three.js" -> **build-a-3d-environment-with-three-js.md**)
- It must be separated by dashes, where appropriate. (e.g. "Data Types" -> **data-types.md**, "HashTable" -> **hashtable.md**)
- The file name should always be lowercase. (e.g. "Array" -> **array.md**, "HTML" -> **html.md**)
- Punctuation must not be included in the file name, even if it exists in the article name. (e.g. "Moore's Law" -> **moores-law.md**, "Three.js" -> "**three-js.md**)

| `DatePublished` | The date published on GitHub in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. | DatePublished: "2022-02-28" |
| `Categories`       | Slugs of Codecademy languages and subjects. We're storing all of our Catloris in the [categories.md file](https://github.com/Codecademy/ugc/blob/main/documentation/categories.md). Please only use Categories from that list.<br /> - We aim to include an average of 1-2 subjects (and always at least 1!) with every article.                                                                                                             | Categories:<br /> - "web-development"<br /> - "game-development"<br /> - "javascript"<br /> - "html-css"                                    |
| `Tags`           | Key words that are relevant to the article. We're storing all of our Tags in the [tags.md file](https://github.com/Codecademy/ugc/blob/main/documentation/tags.md). Please only use Tags from that list, but if that list feels insufficient, feel free to create a new Tag and add it to tags.md in your PR!<br /> - We aim to include an average of 3-4 tags with every article.                                                                     | Tags:<br /> - "Three.js"<br /> - "Animation"<br /> - "Node.js"<br />                                         |

We're storing all of our slugs in the [catalog-content.md file](https://github.com/Codecademy/ugc/blob/main/documentation/catalog-content.md).<br /> - Please avoid linking to individual content items, because their URLs may change and some are gated by Pro membership.<br /> - We aim to include 2 slugs with every article (1 free course and 1 Pro course/Path). | CatalogContent:<br /> - "introduction-to-javascript"<br /> - "paths/front-end-engineer-career-path" |


### Content

- All text should be written in Markdown language. For more details on Markdown, see Codecademy's [Curriculum Markdown Style Guide](http://curriculum-documentation.codecademy.com/content-guidelines/markdown-style-guide/).
- Each subsection should begin with a heading of size h2 (i.e. preceded by `##`).
- All in-line code should be delineated by single backticks (`).

#### Code Blocks

All code blocks should be delineated by triple backticks (```)

- C: ```c
- C#: ```cs
- C++: ```cpp
- CSS: ```css
- Error: ```error
- Emojicode: ```emojic
- Golang: ```go
- HTML: ```html
- Java: ```java
- JavaScript: ```js
- Markdown: ```md
- PHP: ```php
- Plaintext: ```plaintext
- Pseudo: ```pseudo
- Python: ```py
- R: ```r
- Ruby: ```rb
- Sass: ```scss
- Scheme: ```scheme
- Shell/Program Output: ```shell
- SQL: ```sql
- Swift: ```swift

#### General Writing Tips

- Avoid referencing information that isn't strictly related to the topic of the article. As a rule, you want to assume as little pre-existing knowledge as possible.
- Avoid using first- and second-person pronouns (e.g. I, we, you) if possible.
- Brevity without sacrificing clarity. Make every word count.
- If the concept is hard, make it easy. If it's dry, make it fun. If it's simple, keep it simple.
- 90% of writing is rewriting.

#### Images and Source Code

If you'd like to include an image, video, GIF, or other file in your article, please upload it to the same article folder. That way we'll never have any broken links! 

**Note:** Each image/video/GIF should be < 1MB.
